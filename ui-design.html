      <h1 class="amarante-regular game-title">RE-IMAGINING OF SKYRIM’S INVENTORY</h1>
      <p>
        This was a personal project to make a re-imagining of the Skyrim inventory system inside of Figma. The
        motivation for this specific choice was due to it feeling outdated and clunky to use. The goal of this
        re-design was to make the inventory system more accessible and efficient for players to use.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/images/skyrim/skyrim1.webp"/>
      <p>
        Skyrim’s current system consists of a list of items in text form, the player being able to filter items by
        categories such as ‘apparel’ and ‘books.’ The item list is in alphabetical order with no other way to sort items
        other than using the ‘favourite’ option to categorise their own items. To view any item’s stats the player must
        scroll to that item. Because of these reasons I felt that this system could be adjusted to better suit the needs
        of its player base. To start, I recreated the current inventory system in Figma as a reference point for all my
        future designs.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/images/skyrim/skyrim2.webp"/>
      <p>
        For my first prototype the menu has been moved to the top of the screen and the items in the list have been
        given icons to help the player recognise what each item is at a glance rather than needing to read the name. The
        menu was moved to take advantage of the currently unused space at the top of the screen and give more horizontal
        space to iterate the item menu. I wanted to use simple icons with colour coding to keep the minimalist approach
        of the original whilst adding needed clarity and visual information to the items. These icons range from items
        that effect or interact with health, magic, stamina, types of resistances, strengths modifiers, if stolen and
        miscellaneous effects. I also wanted to maintain the monochromatic colour scheme of the original and the
        immersive background in my design as those were key aspects of the original inventory.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/images/skyrim/skyrim3.webp"/>
      <p>
        For the second prototype I decided to add a filtering and sort option. I did this through a toggleable option at
        the top of the inventory section that would be controlled with the triggers of the controller. These sorting
        options would include alphabetical, weight, value, value to weight, quantity and types of properties (grouped
        icons from previous design). This design would allow the player to navigate the long lists of items much easier
        by filtering to what they require at the time.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/images/skyrim/skyrim4.webp"/>
      <p>
        For my third prototype I wanted to try and combat the long list format that I found frustrating by implementing
        a grid-based system. This grid would use the current images for the items and the icons I introduced in
        prototype-1, make the inventory visible at a glance and increase the amount on screen whilst maintaining the
        minimalist look. This design would also make use of more of the screen space available by expanding into the
        centre of the screen. To accommodate this new layout, I also added a cursor system to select the items instead
        of the normal scrolling. This design was made to try and reduce time spent getting to items in the inventory
        with the new visual approach rather than the text previously.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/images/skyrim/skyrim5.webp"/>
      <p>
        For my final prototype I wanted to hit on all my favourite aspects I’d tried and focus on prototype 2 as that
        had the one I found the most successful. I added symbols by the side of the items depending on their sub-type to
        allow for quick recognition when scrolling through the list and add more visually appealing elements that
        weren't text. I also added a toggle to extend the inventory box to display more information such as the items
        type, weight and value. This feature makes use of the empty space in the centre of the screen whilst allowing
        more  player choice on the amount of detail displayed. This design will allow novice users to have a streamlined
        experience whilst more advanced users can utilise these settings to the fullest.

        Waste Away was an 8-man team endeavour, working with other student programmers, designers and 3D artists over a
        3-month period. As part of being assigned design lead over the project I also took charge over the games user
        interface and visual aesthetic.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a management game players need to be able to make informed decisions at a glance and so clarity was the
        biggest pillar in my wireframes for the games UI. I used Balsamiq to create my wireframes due to it naturally
        lending itself to rapid prototyping and amongst a team environment I wanted to constantly be seeking feedback
        and iterating on my designs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond functionality, visual appeal played a crucial role. The game's colour palette was chosen under my
        guidance. I created a few different palettes aiming for a balance between thematic representation and user
        comfort that I had my team vote for individual colours they thought fit. I then crafted two final palettes from
        the ones the team most resonated with and we settled on striking selection of teal greens, a rich blue and a
        pop of burnt orange to contrast and complement.
      </p>

        The wireframes I created were instrumental in guiding the development of the in-game UI. They outlined the
        layout, hierarchy, and interactions of various elements, ensuring consistency and clarity throughout the user
        interface. By collaborating closely with the development team, I was able to refine the wireframes to align with
        technical constraints and optimise the overall user experience.
