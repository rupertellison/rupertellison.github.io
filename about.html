      Hello! My name is Rupert and I love games (<span class="strike">a little too much tbh</span>). I hold a BSc (Hons)
      in Game Design from Manchester Metropolitan University. I am currently based in Cambridge.

      Ever since the day my dad brought home a PlayStation 1, a whole new world opened for me and my sisters. We spent
      countless hours exploring fantastical landscapes, solving puzzles, and battling strange creatures. I became
      obsessed with understanding how these worlds were built, how they made me feel and how I could create something
      just as captivating. From that moment on, the dream of bringing my own games to life took root. Every new game I
      play fuels my passion for design, mechanics, and storytelling. Now, I'm on a mission to turn that dream into
      reality.
